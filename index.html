        <h2 id="me">About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello I'm Raf Bergs and I'm an applied computer science student at
          Thomas More Geel. I've always liked computers, so I decided to start
          learning more about them and then ended up here. I decided to go for
          the specialzation of application development because being able to
          make stuff interested me more than the other options.
        </p>

        <p>Outside of computer related hobbies I also play volleyball.</p>

        <p>
          I'm still open to a lot of future possibilities when it comes down to
          my professional career. For now I'm focusing on learning as much as I
          can so I can pin down what exactly I want to do in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Requirements analysis</h3>
        <p>
          During our requirements analysis class we were given a task to figure
          out a solution for a problem. The other people of my group and I were
          tasked with finding a solution for a consultancy company. We were
          given some earlier analysis done by a different group earlier on and
          then took this input and improved upon it. Thanks to the previous
          group we had a good idea what we had to make but still largely started
          over with our own interpretation of the project. We started by
          thinking about which data needed to be stored inside a database and
          made a schema for this database. afterwards we made a use case diagram
          and some prototypes to show the client, so we could receive the needed
          feedback. Once both those earlier steps were completed we put both of
          them together in an analysis report. My main task in the project was
          developing some of the prototypes as well as making sure the analysis
          report was neat and orderly. I did also help with a bit of
          brainstorming for the database and interviewing the client. Here's an
          example of a prototype:
        </p>
        <img
          src="/prototype.png"
          alt="prototype example"
          width="562"
          height="379"
        />
        <p>
          During this project I got better at working in team as well as getting
          better at thinking like an analyst and realizing how certain things
          should be stored in a database while making sure everything remains
          flexible.
        </p>

        <h3>AI Game</h3>

        <p>
          During my first year at the Thomas More I worked on a project where we
          had to use AI to change the controls of a game as well as making
          something that could recognize certain animals. This was another group
          project and my main task in the group was training the AI machines and
          scraping the web for the needed images as well as looking through all
          the images to make sure there aren't any wrong images in there. I was
          also the one who hosted the website we made for the game in the end.
          We changed the controls for the game 2048, so instead of moving the
          blocks with your keyboard we were able to use our voice or webcam for
          it. I still have the site hosted, so you can visit it with the link
          below.

        </p>
        <p>
          The main thing I learned in this project was working with the AI tools
          google provided, and this project was also my introduction to
          JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h3>PHP project</h3>

        <p>
          During my second semester of my second year at the Thomas More we got
          tasked with building a web-application for an imaginary consultancy
          company. For this project we had to use laravel. This was also a
          project where we got an entire semester to work on it in team. We were
          always present on campus so we could work together and then used git
          and github to work together on the code for the project. To divide and
          keep track of the tasks within the project we used Jira, with Jira we
          could see who was working on what and which tasks were done or still
          had to be done. Everyone's work was divided equally and fair over the
          teammembers. The things that I did was work on the CRUD for the
          business developer so he could manage all the consultants within the
          company as well as helping others solve errors and some other tasks on
          the side such as writing certain reports. When it comes to things I've
          learned in this project I mainly learned working together in team
          using git, github and Jira. You can visit the web-application we made
          with the link below.
